# CyberLex Sweden

CyberLex Sweden is a final school project focused on building an AI-style assistant for Swedish cybersecurity law and digital compliance.

The goal is to help users search and understand selected Swedish cyber law topics by using a trusted local knowledge base, source-based search, simple answer generation, and official source links.

CyberLex Sweden is an educational prototype. It does not provide official legal advice.

## Project Purpose

Cybersecurity law can be difficult to understand because relevant information is spread across different sources, such as:

- Swedish law
- EU regulations and directives
- Swedish government agencies
- cybersecurity authorities
- data protection authorities

CyberLex Sweden explores how a focused AI-style assistant can help users find relevant cybersecurity law information in a safer and more transparent way.

## Current Features

The current prototype can:

- Load local Markdown knowledge base files
- Split source documents into searchable chunks
- Match user questions to relevant source sections
- Generate simple source-based answers
- Display the source file and source section used
- Display official source links connected to the answer
- Show the matched source excerpt
- Refuse out-of-scope questions
- Display legal disclaimers
- Display source metadata, including source date and version notes
- Display official source links connected to the answer
- Display source metadata, including source date and version notes
- Show the matched source excerpt

## Current Scope

CyberLex Sweden currently focuses on:

- GDPR and personal data breaches
- IMY and data protection responsibility
- NIS2 and Swedish cybersecurity responsibilities
- Cybersecurity incident reporting
- Swedish cybercrime law
- Dataintrång
- Unauthorized access and information system interference

Out-of-scope questions, such as Swedish tax law, should be refused by the application.
